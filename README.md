In the midst of an ecological crisis, one of Canada's largest environmental problems is being caused by one of its smallest critters - the dreaded Mountain Pine Beetle. Between 1990 and 2012, the Beetle ate its way through approximately 723 million cubic metres (53%) of all the merchantable pine in BC, and it's on the rise again today.

We present an all in one system for combatting this epidemic, comprising:

- Convolutional Neural Network model for detecting standing dead pines from satellite imagery, to enable automatic targeting of regions suffering from the beetle.
- Drone attachment for available hobby drones (cheap and could be "borrowed" by national park service when not in use by local citizens) to enable spraying of trees on the periphery of an affected area with insecticide to create a "firebreak".
- Web server with 3D globe for viewing the drone's progress.
